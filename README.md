# Nearfleet Test Project

## Technical Test
Project built in Flutter and NodeJS with Express.

### Instructions to run backend:
  - run 'npm start' command in the backend folder

### Notes for Frontend
  - First we have to run the backend code
  - We should create an .env file for our BASE_URL variables.
  - We can execute the app in Web, iOS and Android
  - Some tests have been added and we can run them by entering each file (integration_test/app_test.dart and test/unit_test.dart).
  - For a project of this magnitude I wouldn't add so many packages, however the purpose was to show what I normally do when I know that a project has to be scalable.
